bio: I enjoy the challenges that require self-demanding and tasks that involve the use of creativity. I dream of the problems to be solved, since I constantly think of ideas and ways to approach them, in order to obtain the best results. Passionate about what I do, I look for excellence in products and information that makes a difference when making correct decisions. I am always learning something, I am currently growing as a golang developer and I am learning AWS.
