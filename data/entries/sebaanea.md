# Hi üëã, I'm Sebastian
### A fullstack developer from Argentina

I¬¥m a fullstack developer and Computer Science student
I started learning programming in 2019, through youtube videos and Udemy courses.
in 2020 I was part of Digitalers, a Telecom program to train professionals in web development with Python.
I recently graduated from Henry, an intensive bootcamp of more than 800 hours where I trained as a fullstack javascript developer.

Why me ‚ùì

I'm not just a developer. I'm a curious person, a bit nerdy üëì, wanting to grow and develop my full potential.
I like science, philosophy and too many other topics to list. If there is something I don't know, I have to go and find out how it works.
